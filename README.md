# Taxi Trip Data Analysis with Apache Spark and Neo4j

## Project Overview

This project analyzes taxi trip data using **Apache Spark** and **Neo4j** to uncover insights and optimize data processing performance. Key objectives include:

- Cleaning and preprocessing large taxi trip datasets.
- Comparing the performance of **Parquet** and **Delta** formats for distributed data processing.
- Graph-based analysis of taxi zones using Neo4j to identify community clusters and centrality.

---

## Features

### 1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Removed invalid records (e.g., zero distance, no passengers).
- Eliminated outliers.
- Added derived columns to enhance analysis.
- Joined trip data with taxi zone datasets.
- Computed unit profitability for each trip.

### 2. Dataset Summarization and Ranking
- Summarized trip data for each zone.
- Ranked zones based on:
  - Total trip volume.
  - Average profitability.
  - Total passenger volume.
- Measured task-specific execution times for various dataset sizes and formats.

---

### 3. Format Performance Comparison
#### Metrics Evaluated:
- Number of rows processed.
- Execution time.
- Time per million records.

#### Key Findings:
- **Delta format** consistently outperformed **Parquet** in execution time and scalability, especially with larger datasets:
  - Smallest dataset: Delta was **1.5x faster** than Parquet.
  - Largest dataset: Delta processed **48x faster** than Parquet.

### 4. Graph-Based Analysis with Neo4j
#### Algorithms and Queries:
1. **Louvain Algorithm**:
   - Detects communities in an undirected graph weighted by the "trips" property.
   - Outputs:
     - Number of communities in stats mode.
     - Zone-community mapping in stream mode.

2. **PageRank Centrality**:
   - Computes centrality in a directed graph.
   - Outputs:
     - Min/max centrality scores in stats mode.
     - Zone-centrality mapping in stream mode.

3. **Top Centrality Zones**:
   - Identifies the top 3 centrality zones per community.
   - Combines community and centrality data for targeted insights.

#### Neo4j Workflow:
- Created in-memory graph projections.
- Estimated memory usage for algorithms (optional).
- Ran algorithms in stats and stream modes.
- Exported results to CSV for analysis.
